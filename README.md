# LLMâ€™s API Random User Discrepancy 

Java, Open AI API based application where complex JSON structure gets flattened and discrepancies are saved in a database. 

## Description

LLM's Random User Discrepancy is a Java-based application that integrates with OpenAI's API, along with tools from Google Gemma and Facebook Llama, to analyze and resolve discrepancies in complex JSON data structures. This application is designed to flatten nested JSON data, identify inconsistencies, and record these discrepancies in a database, making it an essential tool for data integrity and analysis.

### Key Features:
* Complex Data Handling: Processes and flattens nested JSON structures to simplify data analysis and manipulation.
* Discrepancy Detection: Utilizes algorithms to detect and log discrepancies between different data sets, ensuring high data quality and reliability.
* Integration with Major APIs: Leverages APIs from Google Gemma, Facebook Llama, and OpenAI to enhance data processing and discrepancy analysis capabilities.
* Database Logging: Saves identified discrepancies in a structured database, allowing for historical data tracking and auditing.
* Scalable Architecture: Built with scalability in mind, the application can handle large volumes of data and complex JSON structures without compromising performance.

This project serves as a tool for developers and analysts dealing with large and complex datasets, providing a robust solution for ensuring data accuracy and consistency across systems.
